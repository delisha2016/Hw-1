            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>My name is Daryn Delisha Forman, and I was born in the beautiful town of Punta Gorda. I am 24 years old and currently pursuing my bachelor's degree at the University of Belize.</p>
            <p>Throughout my life, I've always found solace in books, losing myself in the stories and knowledge they offer. My love for reading has been a constant companion, providing both comfort and inspiration. Alongside reading, I have a deep appreciation for nature. There's something incredibly calming about exploring the outdoors, whether it's walking through lush forests or simply enjoying the serenity of a quiet beach.</p>
            <p>Although I can be a bit timid, I believe that my quiet nature allows me to observe and appreciate the world around me in ways that others might overlook. I value deep connections with the people I care about and cherish the simple joys that life offers.</p>
            <p>As I continue my studies, I look forward to discovering more about myself and the world, all while staying true to the things that bring me happiness.</p>
