    <!-- Problem 1: Washing Machine Control Panel -->
    <section>
        <h2>Problem 1: Washing Machine Control Panel</h2>
        <img src="Dial.jpg" alt="Washing Machine Control Panel" width="200" height="200">
        <p><strong>What is wrong with it?</strong></p>
        <p>The control panel on the washing machine dial is difficult to read. The symbols are not intuitive, especially for first-time users, and the layout is cluttered with too many options.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Usability Issues:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Learnability:</strong> New users may struggle to operate the machine without consulting the manual.</li>
            <li><strong>Efficiency:</strong> Small, cramped buttons make laundry tasks more time-consuming.</li>
            <li><strong>Safety:</strong> Misreading the controls could lead to incorrect settings, like using the wrong water temperature.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Suggested Fixes:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Add text labels next to symbols for clarity.</li>
            <li>Use color coding to differentiate cycles quickly.</li>
            <li>Increase icon size for better visibility.</li>
        </ul>

    <!-- Problem 2: Inserting Batteries -->
    <section>
        <h2>Problem 2: Inserting Batteries</h2>
        <img src="B1.jpeg" alt="Battery Insertion 1" width="200" height="200">
        <img src="b2.jpeg" alt="Battery Insertion 2" width="200" height="200">
        
        <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
        <p>Inserting batteries can be confusing due to unclear markings, and they are often difficult to remove. Additionally, users have no way to know when the batteries are close to dying.</p>

        <p><strong>Usability Issues:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Learnability:</strong> Difficulty in identifying the correct battery orientation.</li>
            <li><strong>Efficiency:</strong> Lack of battery life indicators leads to unexpected device shutdowns.</li>
            <li><strong>Safety:</strong> Misuse could result in battery leakage, overheating, or explosion.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Suggested Fixes:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Add battery life indicators (e.g., LED lights).</li>
            <li>Use a textured surface for better grip during removal.</li>
            <li>Color-code polarity markings for easier identification.</li>
        </ul>

    <!-- Problem 3: Elevator Buttons -->
    <section>
        <h2>Problem 3: Elevator Buttons</h2>
        <img src="elevator.jpeg" alt="Elevator Buttons" width="200" height="200">
        
        <p><strong>What is wrong with it?</strong></p>
        <p>The elevator buttons are poorly labeled, clustered together, and difficult to use, especially in emergencies.</p>

        <p><strong>Usability Issues:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Learnability:</strong> Lack of clear labels makes it harder to find the correct button quickly.</li>
            <li><strong>Efficiency:</strong> A cluttered layout can cause delays as users search for the right button.</li>
            <li><strong>Safety:</strong> The help button is placed too low, making it inaccessible in an emergency.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Suggested Fixes:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Organize buttons logically and label them clearly.</li>
            <li>Reposition the help button at an accessible height.</li>
            <li>Group related buttons (e.g., floor numbers together, function buttons in another area).</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- Conclusion -->
    <section>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Usability issues in everyday objects can significantly impact user experience. By focusing on key dimensions such as Learnability, Efficiency, and Safety, designers can create more intuitive and user-friendly products.</p>
